    <h1>Learn PHP - A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to PHP</h2>
        <p>PHP, or Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and now stands as one of the most widely used languages on the internet.</p>
        <p>PHP code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client receives the results of running that script, but does not know what the underlying code was. PHP can be embedded into HTML code, or used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks.</p>
